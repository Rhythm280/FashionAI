# 👗 FashionAI: RAG-Based Fashion Semantic Search Engine

FashionAI is an intelligent semantic search engine tailored for the fashion e-commerce domain. Powered by **GPT-4** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture, it bridges the gap between human expression and fashion product discovery by understanding natural language queries and delivering highly relevant, context-aware results.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

* 🔍 **Semantic Search**: Understands queries like “casual summer dresses for women” and retrieves the most contextually relevant items.
* 🧠 **GPT-4 Integration**: This module uses OpenAI's GPT-4 for contextual understanding and natural language generation.
* 📦 **Vector Search**: Employs FAISS or Pinecone for efficient embedding-based retrieval of fashion items.
* 👥 **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggests complementary items based on user intent and preferences.
* ⚡ **Fast & Scalable**: Optimized with microservices, caching, and scalable vector search for handling high traffic.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
/client               → React frontend
  /components         → Reusable UI components (SearchBar, ResultsGrid, etc.)
  /context            → Context APIs for query and results
  /hooks              → Custom hook for search logic
/server               → Node.js backend
  /controllers        → API handlers including GPT-4 integration
  /routes             → Express routes
  /utils              → Helpers (embedding, Pinecone/FAISS integration)
```

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **User Query** → A fashion-related phrase is entered via UI.
2. **Query Embedding** → Converted into a semantic vector via sentence-transformer.
3. **Vector Store** → Top-k similar items fetched from FAISS/Pinecone.
4. **GPT-4** → Enhances and contextualizes results.
5. **Results Displayed** → Intelligent, stylish recommendations are shown to the user.
